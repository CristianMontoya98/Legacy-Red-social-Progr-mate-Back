This project allows to create and maintain a solid community between trainers, students and ex students of the "Progr√°mate" Bootcamp dictated by the Educam√°s Foundation. Its main objective is to keep them in touch by sharing valuable and important information about web development, job offers, upcoming events and even programming tips.
Besides, a question and answer section was enabled for persons who prefer to debate with the ‚ÄúProgr√°mate‚Äù community, instead of getting  information of internet pages.
